# Reasoning Mode Taxonomy

This file is the canonical reference for which mode applies to which problem shape.

## How to Read This File

When a category skill is loaded, the skill can read from this taxonomy to (a) confirm the problem fits its mode, and (b) recommend switching to a different mode if it does not fit.

## v0.2.0 Modes (all 34 available)
