The user invoked `/think` with these arguments:

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## What to do

Parse the arguments above. The first word may be one of the 34 available modes:

**think-standard**
- **`sequential`** — Iterative step-by-step reasoning. Breaking down a task into ordered thoughts with revision support.
- **`shannon`** — Information-theoretic decomposition tracking uncertainty across 5 stages.
- **`hybrid`** — Composing multiple modes for cross-cutting multidimensional problems.

**think-core**
- **`inductive`** — Reasoning from specific observations to general principles. Pattern recognition across cases.
- **`deductive`** — Reasoning from established premises to specific conclusions. Formal logical inference.
- **`abductive`** — Finding the best explanation among competing hypotheses for a surprising observation.

**think-mathematics**
- **`mathematics`** — Formal proofs, algebraic reasoning, mathematical modeling.
- **`physics`** — Physical models, conservation laws, tensor analysis, symmetries.
- **`computability`** — Decidability, complexity classes, Turing machines, reductions.

**think-temporal**
- **`temporal`** — Event ordering, time intervals, Allen relations, sequence vs. causation.
- **`historical`** — Source reliability, precedent analysis, patterns across historical episodes.

**think-probabilistic**
- **`bayesian`** — Updating beliefs with evidence via Bayes' theorem (posterior calculation).
- **`evidential`** — Multi-source evidence evaluation, Dempster-Shafer belief/plausibility.

**think-causal**
- **`causal`** — Cause-effect mechanisms, confounders, causal graphs.
- **`counterfactual`** — What-if reasoning, interventions, alternative histories.

**think-strategic**
- **`gametheory`** — Multi-agent strategic interaction, Nash equilibria, payoff matrices.
- **`optimization`** — Finding the best allocation given an objective and constraints.
- **`constraint`** — Satisfying a set of hard rules (feasibility, not optimality).

**think-analytical**
- **`analogical`** — Mapping structural similarity between source and target domains.
- **`firstprinciples`** — Decomposing to fundamental truths and rebuilding from axioms.
- **`metareasoning`** — Reasoning ABOUT reasoning — monitoring and switching reasoning modes.
- **`cryptanalytic`** — Signal-from-noise extraction, Decibans-weighted evidence, pattern breaking.

**think-scientific**
- **`scientificmethod`** — Hypothesis → prediction → experiment → observation → revision (falsifiability).
- **`systemsthinking`** — Feedback loops, systems archetypes, leverage points, emergent behavior.
- **`formallogic`** — Propositional and predicate logic, formal proof structures.

**think-engineering**
- **`engineering`** — Design trade-offs, FMEA, trade studies, constraint-driven decisions.
- **`algorithmic`** — CLRS algorithm selection, complexity analysis, data structure choice.

**think-academic**
- **`synthesis`** — Integrating multiple sources with coverage tracking (literature review).
- **`argumentation`** — Building arguments using the Toulmin model (claim/warrant/backing/rebuttal).
- **`critique`** — Peer-review evaluation with Socratic questions and strengths/weaknesses.
- **`analysis`** — Layered systematic decomposition (surface → structure → patterns → synthesis).

**think-advanced**
- **`recursive`** — Self-referential problem decomposition (base case + recursive case + halting).
- **`modal`** — Possibility/necessity reasoning (alethic, epistemic, deontic modalities).
- **`stochastic`** — Probability distributions, random processes, Monte Carlo analysis.

If the first word is a recognized mode name, apply that method. If the first word is NOT a mode name (or no mode was given), treat the entire `$ARGUMENTS` as the problem and auto-recommend a mode.

## Auto-Recommendation

For auto-recommendation, consult the decision tree in `skills/think/mode-index.md`.

## Method Instructions

Load the relevant category skill for background on the method:

- **sequential, shannon, hybrid** → read `skills/think-standard/SKILL.md`
- **inductive, deductive, abductive** → read `skills/think-core/SKILL.md`
- **mathematics, physics, computability** → read `skills/think-mathematics/SKILL.md`
- **temporal, historical** → read `skills/think-temporal/SKILL.md`
- **bayesian, evidential** → read `skills/think-probabilistic/SKILL.md`
- **causal, counterfactual** → read `skills/think-causal/SKILL.md`
- **gametheory, optimization, constraint** → read `skills/think-strategic/SKILL.md`
- **analogical, firstprinciples, metareasoning, cryptanalytic** → read `skills/think-analytical/SKILL.md`
- **scientificmethod, systemsthinking, formallogic** → read `skills/think-scientific/SKILL.md`
- **engineering, algorithmic** → read `skills/think-engineering/SKILL.md`
- **synthesis, argumentation, critique, analysis** → read `skills/think-academic/SKILL.md`
- **recursive, modal, stochastic** → read `skills/think-advanced/SKILL.md`

Then read `reference/output-formats/<mode>.md` for the authoritative JSON schema the output must match.

## Output Format

Every response from `/think` MUST follow this structure:

1. **One sentence of meta** — explain which mode was chosen and (if auto-recommend) why.
2. **A JSON code block** containing the structured thought matching the mode's schema.
3. **A short natural-language summary** (2-4 sentences) explaining the reasoning for humans.

### Example response

Using inductive reasoning to generalize from the three observed deployment failures.

```json
{
  "mode": "inductive",
  "observations": [
    "Deploy on Monday 2026-04-06 failed with DB connection timeout",
    "Deploy on Wednesday 2026-04-08 failed with DB connection timeout",
    "Deploy on Friday 2026-04-10 failed with DB connection timeout"
  ],
  "pattern": "All recent deploys fail at the DB connection phase",
  "generalization": "Recent production deploys consistently fail at the DB connection phase, suggesting a configuration or network issue introduced prior to 2026-04-06",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "sampleSize": 3
}
```

The three deploy failures all occurred at the same phase with identical symptoms, which supports a strong generalization that the issue is upstream of DB connection handling. Confidence is 0.85 because the sample is small (n=3) and we have not yet ruled out confounders.
