"""
test_skill_invariants.py — validate per-mode rules that JSON Schema cannot enforce.

The canonical catalog of these rules is docs/SKILL-INVARIANTS.md. A given
mode's JSON Schema defines the SHAPE of a valid thought, but cannot express
constraints like "exactly one element of this array has isActual=true" or
"the conclusion's confidence must not exceed the minimum in its derivation
chain". Those invariants live in the skill prose (skills/think-<category>/
SKILL.md) and are expected to be followed by the model.

This test walks both test/samples/<mode>-valid.json (the hand-crafted
reference fixtures, always checked) and test/smoke/captured/<mode>-parsed.json
(the last real Claude output, checked only if present) and applies the
invariant check for each relevant mode. It complements test/harness.py:

  - harness.py    : does the thought MATCH the schema?
  - this file     : does the thought HONOR the schema-unenforceable rules?

Exit 0 if every applicable file satisfies its invariant; exit non-zero on
any failure with a clear per-check report.

Run with `python test/test_skill_invariants.py` — no pytest, no unittest,
plain stdlib. Do NOT run with `python -O` since any `assert` usage would be
stripped (the test uses explicit if/return instead for safety).
