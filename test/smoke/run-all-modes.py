"""
Automated smoke test runner for all 34 deepthinking-plugin modes.

Invokes `claude --plugin-dir <plugin_root> --bare -p` for each mode's test prompt,
extracts the JSON code block from Claude's response, and validates it against the
mode's JSON Schema. Writes per-mode captured outputs to test/smoke/captured/.

Usage:
    cd <plugin-root>
    python test/smoke/run-all-modes.py

Environment:
    SMOKE_TIMEOUT   seconds per mode (default 180)
    SMOKE_MODE      if set, only run this single mode (e.g. SMOKE_MODE=bayesian)
    SMOKE_WORKERS   number of parallel workers (default 4, capped at 8).
                    Set SMOKE_WORKERS=1 for the sequential escape hatch.
