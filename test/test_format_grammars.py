"""
test_format_grammars.py — verify that every format grammar file at
reference/visual-grammar/formats/ has the expected structure.

The visual-exporter agent consumes these files when asked to produce output in
formats other than mermaid/dot. A broken template, missing section, or renamed
file would silently degrade the agent's output quality. This test enforces:

1. The expected set of format grammar files is present.
2. Each file has the canonical section headings.
3. Each file is non-trivially sized (>= 400 bytes) so an accidental truncation
   is caught.

The expected set is hardcoded here deliberately: these are a small, stable set
(9 formats) that should only change deliberately. If you add or remove a format
grammar, update EXPECTED below.

Do NOT run with `python -O` — assertions would be stripped.
