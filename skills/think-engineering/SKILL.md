# think-engineering — Engineering and Algorithmic Reasoning Methods

## User Invocation

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

Parse these arguments. The first word should be `engineering` or `algorithmic`. The rest is the problem to reason about. If invoked via the `think` router, `$ARGUMENTS` is the same string the user originally typed after `/think`.

This category skill contains two structured reasoning methods: **Engineering** (systematic design analysis with trade-off matrices, FMEA, and ADR) and **Algorithmic** (CLRS-grounded algorithm design, complexity analysis, and data structure selection).

## Engineering Reasoning

Engineering reasoning provides structured design analysis. It forces explicit trade-off evaluation across competing objectives (correctness, simplicity, performance, cost, reliability) rather than converging prematurely on a single option.

### When to Use

- Choosing between architectures, tools, or technologies where multiple constraints conflict
- Analyzing failure modes before committing to a design
- Documenting design decisions so future engineers understand the rationale
- Evaluating whether a requirement is achievable given cost and schedule constraints
- Any "should we use X or Y?" question that involves real engineering consequences

**Do not use Engineering** when:
- The choice is purely aesthetic or has no meaningful consequences
- Only one option exists → document the constraint instead
- You need algorithmic correctness or complexity analysis → use Algorithmic

### The Core Move: Explicit Trade-Off Analysis

Engineering reasoning is not a list of requirements. It is a comparison of alternatives across weighted criteria. The key discipline:

1. **Name the design challenge** — What is actually being decided?
2. **Identify the constraints** — Budget, latency, team skill, regulatory requirements, uptime SLA. Constraints eliminate alternatives before scoring begins.
3. **Generate at least two alternatives** — Never evaluate a single option. The point is comparison.
4. **Define evaluation criteria with weights** — Common criteria: correctness, simplicity, performance, cost, operational burden, reliability, security. Weights must sum to 1.0.
5. **Score each alternative per criterion** — Use a 1–10 scale. Write a rationale for every score, not just the winner.
6. **Compute weighted scores** — `weightedScore = score × weight`. Sum per alternative.
7. **Identify failure modes** — For the leading alternative, what can go wrong? Use FMEA: Severity × Occurrence × Detection = Risk Priority Number (RPN). High-RPN failures require mitigation before acceptance.
8. **Document the decision** — Capture the winning alternative, the runner-up score, and why the difference justifies the choice. Future engineers need the second-place rationale.
9. **State open issues** — What assumptions require validation? What risks are accepted rather than mitigated?

### Trade-Off Dimensions (Engineering Compass)

| Dimension | What It Measures |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Correctness | Does it reliably produce the right result? |
| Simplicity | How understandable and maintainable is it? |
| Performance | Latency, throughput, resource consumption |
| Cost | Licensing, infrastructure, development time |
| Reliability | MTBF, failure isolation, graceful degradation |
| Operability | Deployability, observability, runbook complexity |
| Security | Attack surface, credential exposure, audit trails |

Not all dimensions apply to every decision. Omit irrelevant criteria — including them with zero weight wastes cognitive effort.

### Verification Before Emitting

- `mode` is exactly `"engineering"`
- `analysisType` is one of: `"requirements"`, `"trade-study"`, `"fmea"`, `"decision"`
- At least **two** alternatives in any trade study — a single-alternative analysis is not a trade study
- Criteria weights sum to 1.0 (within ±0.01 rounding)
- Every score has an explicit `rationale` — bare numbers are not engineering analysis
- `recommendation` points to an `id` that actually exists in `alternatives`
- `assessment.confidence` is in [0, 1]
- High-RPN failure modes (RPN ≥ 100) in any FMEA have a non-empty `mitigation`

### Worked Example

Input: "Should we use a database or a message queue for order processing? What are the trade-offs?"

Analysis:

The design challenge is order processing durability and decoupling. Three alternatives are in scope: (1) synchronous relational DB writes, (2) message queue (Kafka/SQS) with async DB consumer, (3) event sourcing with append-only log.

Criteria and weights:
- Operational simplicity (0.30) — fewer moving parts, easier to debug
- Reliability / at-least-once delivery (0.30) — orders must not be lost
- Throughput scalability (0.20) — handles Black Friday spikes
- Cost / infrastructure burden (0.20) — team size is 4 engineers

Scores (1–10):

| Alternative | Simplicity | Reliability | Throughput | Cost | Weighted Total |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|------------|------|---------------|
| Direct DB | 9 | 6 | 5 | 9 | 7.2 |
| Message Queue | 6 | 9 | 9 | 6 | 7.5 |
| Event Sourcing | 3 | 9 | 9 | 3 | 6.0 |

    "sensitivityNotes": "If the team scales beyond 12 engineers and audit trail requirements increase, re-evaluate event sourcing. If operational simplicity is re-weighted to 0.45, direct DB edges back to 7.65 vs. 7.35 — revisit if the team shrinks further."

Natural-language summary: "The message queue wins on reliability and throughput while remaining tractable for a small team. The score difference is small, so the decision is sensitive to team size and simplicity weighting — document this sensitivity so the decision can be revisited if constraints change. The most important next step is proving out consumer idempotency, not the queue selection itself."

## Algorithmic Reasoning

Algorithmic reasoning provides systematic algorithm design and analysis grounded in CLRS (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein — *Introduction to Algorithms*). It covers problem-to-algorithm matching, complexity analysis (Big-O, Big-Theta, Big-Omega, amortized), recurrence solving, correctness proofs, and data structure selection.

### When to Use

- Selecting an algorithm for a well-defined problem (sorting, searching, shortest path, scheduling)
- Analyzing time and space complexity of existing code
- Proving or disproving that an algorithm is correct
- Choosing a data structure for specific access patterns
- Solving recurrences (Master Theorem, substitution method, recursion tree)
- Recognizing whether a problem has optimal substructure (DP) or a greedy-choice property

**Do not use Algorithmic** when:
- The problem is architectural or involves operational trade-offs → use Engineering
- The analysis is empirical/benchmarking rather than asymptotic → note that distinction explicitly
- No well-defined problem structure exists — brainstorm first, then apply Algorithmic once the problem is characterized

### CLRS Algorithm Categories

The CLRS taxonomy covers every major algorithm design paradigm:

| Category | Key Algorithms | CLRS Chapters |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Divide and Conquer** | Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Strassen's matrix multiply, binary search | 2, 4, 7 |
| **Dynamic Programming** | Rod cutting, LCS, matrix chain, 0/1 knapsack, Floyd-Warshall, Bellman-Ford | 15, 25 |
| **Greedy Algorithms** | Activity selection, Huffman codes, Prim's, Kruskal's, Dijkstra's | 16, 23, 24 |
| **Graph Algorithms** | BFS, DFS, topological sort, SCC (Kosaraju/Tarjan), MST, SSSP, APSP | 22–25 |
| **Sorting and Order Statistics** | Insertion sort, Heapsort, Quicksort, Counting sort, Radix sort, Bucket sort, Randomized select | 2, 6, 7, 8, 9 |
| **Data Structures** | Binary heaps, hash tables, BSTs, Red-Black trees, B-trees, Fibonacci heaps, disjoint sets | 10–14, 19, 21 |
| **String Algorithms** | Naive matching, Rabin-Karp, KMP, Boyer-Moore, suffix arrays | 32 |
| **NP and Approximation** | P vs. NP, Cook's theorem, vertex cover, TSP approximation, set cover | 34–35 |
| **Randomized Algorithms** | Randomized Quicksort, skip lists, hashing with chaining | 5, 7, 11 |
| **Amortized Analysis** | Aggregate, accounting, potential methods; applied to dynamic arrays, splay trees | 17 |
| **Number-Theoretic** | Euclid's GCD, modular exponentiation, Miller-Rabin primality, RSA | 31 |
| **Geometric Algorithms** | Convex hull (Graham scan, Jarvis march), segment intersection, closest pair | 33 |

### How to Reason Algorithmically

1. **Characterize the problem** — Input/output specification, constraints (n size, key type, ordering), and which CLRS category applies.
2. **Identify design pattern** — Divide and conquer? Greedy? DP? Recognition heuristics:
   - *Optimal substructure + overlapping subproblems* → Dynamic Programming
   - *Greedy-choice property: local optimum leads to global optimum* → Greedy
   - *Problem splits into independent subproblems of equal size* → Divide and Conquer
   - *Connectivity, reachability, ordering* → Graph algorithms
3. **Select algorithm** — Name the specific algorithm, cite CLRS chapter/section if applicable.
4. **Analyze complexity** — State worst-case O, average-case Θ, and best-case Ω for both time and space. If recursive, solve the recurrence.
5. **Solve recurrences** — Use Master Theorem when applicable (T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)). Fall back to substitution or recursion-tree methods.
6. **Prove correctness** (when rigor is required) — Loop invariant for iterative algorithms (initialization, maintenance, termination). Induction or exchange argument for greedy. Optimal substructure for DP.
7. **Select data structures** — Match access pattern to structure: random access → array; ordered traversal → BST/sorted array; priority queue → binary heap / Fibonacci heap; amortized O(1) insert+lookup → hash table; union-find → disjoint-set forest.
8. **Compare alternatives** — State runner-up algorithms and why the selected one wins for this problem's constraints.

### Complexity Reference

| Notation | Meaning | Use For |
|----------|---------|---------|
| O(f(n)) | Upper bound | Worst-case guarantees |
| Θ(f(n)) | Tight bound | Average-case when distribution is known |
| Ω(f(n)) | Lower bound | Best-case or impossibility proofs |
| Amortized | Average over sequence of operations | Dynamic arrays, splay trees, union-find |

Common complexity landmarks: O(1) < O(log n) < O(√n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n²) < O(n³) < O(2ⁿ) < O(n!)

### Data Structure Selection Guide

| Access Pattern | Best Structure | Time Complexity |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Random access by index | Array | O(1) read/write |
| Ordered traversal, range queries | Balanced BST (Red-Black) | O(log n) insert/delete/search |
| Frequent min/max extraction | Binary Heap | O(log n) insert, O(1) peek |
| Fast insert + lookup, no order | Hash Table | O(1) amortized |
| Decreasing-key for Dijkstra | Fibonacci Heap | O(1) amortized decrease-key |
| Connectivity queries (union-find) | Disjoint-Set Forest | O(α(n)) amortized |
| Top-K with streaming updates | Min-Heap of size K | O(log K) per update |

### Verification Before Emitting

- `mode` is exactly `"algorithmic"`
- `thoughtType` is a valid type: `algorithm_definition`, `algorithm_selection`, `complexity_analysis`, `recurrence_solving`, `correctness_proof`, `data_structure_selection`, `comparison`
- `timeComplexity` uses correct asymptotic notation — O for worst case, Θ for tight/average, Ω for best case
- `designPattern` matches one of: `divide_and_conquer`, `dynamic_programming`, `greedy`, `graph_traversal`, `branch_and_bound`, `backtracking`, `randomized`
- If `clrsCategory` is present, verify the algorithm actually belongs to that CLRS chapter
- If a recurrence is solved via Master Theorem, state a, b, f(n), and which case applies
- `uncertainty` is in [0, 1]; lower for well-established algorithms, higher for approximate or domain-specific reasoning
- `keyInsight` is the single most important observation — not a summary of all steps

### Worked Example

Input: "Given N=1M items and we need to find the top-K most recent, which algorithm and data structure?"

Analysis:

Problem: streaming N items, extract top-K by recency (timestamp). N=1,000,000, K is typically small (K << N).

Pattern recognition: this is an order-statistic / priority queue problem. We do not need to sort all N items — we need the K largest timestamps. Classic application: maintain a min-heap of size K. For each incoming item, if its timestamp exceeds the heap minimum, replace the minimum. After all N items, the heap contains the top-K.

Time complexity: O(N log K). Naive full sort would be O(N log N) — for K=100 and N=1M, log K ≈ 7 vs. log N ≈ 20, roughly 3× faster in asymptotic terms.

Space complexity: O(K) auxiliary — we only store K items at any time, not all N.

Natural-language summary: "Use a min-heap of size K. Scan all N items once: for each item, if the heap is not full, push it; otherwise push-and-pop only if the new item beats the current minimum. This is O(N log K) time and O(K) space — asymptotically and practically better than sorting when K is small. For N=1M, K=100: roughly 7 million heap operations vs. 20 million comparisons for merge sort. If K approaches N/2, switch to max-heapify over all N in O(N) and extract K times."
